After a frustrating few months, where I was finding vue, axios, and laravel not communiticating well with authentication of Sanctum, I decided to follow the more recommended way with Laravel breeze, inertia, and vue.  I was using in this iteration an older Laravel UI that required vue router and vuex.  I was finding while the main page was fine.  Once I putting authentication, Sanctum, into it, it would crash.
